This crate is a Rust library for serialising to and deserialising from
querystrings using [`serde`][Serde]. This crate is designed to extend [`serde_urlencoded`][urlencoded]
when using nested parameters, similar to those used by [qs][qs] for Node, and
commonly used by Ruby on Rails via [Rack][Rack].

The core of the library was inspired by [`serde_urlencoded`][urlencoded].
In order to support _deserializing_ abitrarily nested structs encoded in arbitrary orders, we
perform two passes over the input string. This adds a non-trivial amount
of memory and compute, approximately a 50% overhead compared to `serde_urlencoded`.
However, in absolute terms, deserialization is on the order of single-digit microseconds.

Similarly, serialization needs to buffer keys in case there are nested values,
resulting in about 50% overhead.

For detailed benchmark documentation, see [`benches/README.md`](benches/README.md).

Installation
============

This crate works with Cargo and can be found on
[crates.io] with a `Cargo.toml` like:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde_qs = "0.13"
```

Minimum supported Rust version is 1.68.

For older versions of Rust, `serde_qs` versions `<= 0.11` support Rust 1.36.
